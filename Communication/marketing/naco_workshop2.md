# Workshop 2

## What Should be in Your Pitch Deck?
- With limited time you have to convey the potential to angel investors and encourage them to learn more and invest in you. Tell a **compelling story** with **promised outcomes**.

| Goal | Challenge | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convinice the audience to take an action and **be genuine** | Getting the attention of the angel investors who hear pitches all day | Make the Deck clear, succinct, and impossible to forget |

### Company Pitch Expectations

| Art | Science | Promotion not Selling | Knowledgeable and Prepared | Concise Presentations | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Art** is what founders must use in telling the story with visually with passion, rationale, vision, and necessary to account for potentially no traction in sales, partnerships, and in some cases -- no product -- but an idea. | **Science** is how the audience evaluates and receives the pitch from their own internal checklist/needs/wants and ultimately comes down to: do they trust that you will do what you said you would | Pitching to angel investors is **not selling to customers**; you should be promoting your company, not selling | You should know more than the investor about the market, competition, and opportunities | Typically a 12 - 15 minute presentation, and a 10 minute question period |

## PACES system

| **P**roblem | **A**nswer | **C**redibility | **E**vidence | **S**teps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What problem will you solve?; How do you know it's a problem?; Did potential customer or marketplace tell you so? | Outline your business, your solution, and its features/capabilities. | Key people (and Advisors, if any) | How do you know this will solve the problem? | What is your next step to further solution? How will you execute what you said you will do? |
| Who and How are they impacted by the problem? | If you have one, show your prototype, and how it works. | Who (customers, experts, organizations) did you speak to about your solution? Where will/did market validation come from? | Who (customers, experts, organizations) did you speak to about your solution? Where will/did market validation come from? | What do you need to move ahead? If, you're asking for investor money, what will you use it for? Waht does success look like for all? |
|  | How does it solve the problem? How unique is it to current offerings? | How will you make money? What are the big assumptions you've made, and have you validated those assumptions? | How will you make money? What are the big assumptions you've made, and have you validated those assumptions? | Many can tell you how they started and got here, but few can give rationale of how they will get to where they want to go - **That's your differentiator!** |

Note:
- Investors look for credibility in teams because teams are important in executing business/marketing strategy.
- *Team is always number 1 in mind.*
