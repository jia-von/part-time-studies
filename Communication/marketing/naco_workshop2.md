# Workshop 2

## What Should be in Your Pitch Deck?
- With limited time you have to convey the potential to angel investors and encourage them to learn more and invest in you. Tell a **compelling story** with **promised outcomes**.

| Goal | Challenge | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convinice the audience to take an action and **be genuine** | Getting the attention of the angel investors who hear pitches all day | Make the Deck clear, succinct, and impossible to forget |

### Company Pitch Expectations

| Art | Science | Promotion not Selling | Knowledgeable and Prepared | Concise Presentations | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Art** is what founders must use in telling the story with visually with passion, rationale, vision, and necessary to account for potentially no traction in sales, partnerships, and in some cases -- no product -- but an idea. | **Science** is how the audience evaluates and receives the pitch from their own internal checklist/needs/wants and ultimately comes down to: do they trust that you will do what you said you would | Pitching to angel investors is **not selling to customers**; you should be promoting your company, not selling | You should know more than the investor about the market, competition, and opportunities | Typically a 12 - 15 minute presentation, and a 10 minute question period |

## PACES system

| **P**roblem | **A**nswer | **C**redibility | **E**vidence | **S**teps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What problem will you solve?; How do you know it's a problem?; Did potential customer or marketplace tell you so? | Outline your business, your solution, and its features/capabilities. | Key people (and Advisors, if any) | How do you know this will solve the problem? | What is your next step to further solution? How will you execute what you said you will do? |
| Who and How are they impacted by the problem? | If you have one, show your prototype, and how it works. | Who (customers, experts, organizations) did you speak to about your solution? Where will/did market validation come from? | Who (customers, experts, organizations) did you speak to about your solution? Where will/did market validation come from? | What do you need to move ahead? If, you're asking for investor money, what will you use it for? Waht does success look like for all? |
|  | How does it solve the problem? How unique is it to current offerings? | How will you make money? What are the big assumptions you've made, and have you validated those assumptions? | How will you make money? What are the big assumptions you've made, and have you validated those assumptions? | Many can tell you how they started and got here, but few can give rationale of how they will get to where they want to go - **That's your differentiator!** |

Note:
- Investors look for credibility in teams because teams are important in executing business/marketing strategy.
- *Team is always number 1 in mind.*
- *Investor doesn't want to hear: raise money to do more research, to do something, to hire more people*
- *It's okay to get input from investor*
- *Few can illustrate where a company wants to go*
- *Capture clear vision moving forward, how the market is trending*

## Due Diligence

| Due Diligence | Investor | Entrepreneur | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| A process that investors take understand a business - its assets, liabilities, and potential | They are thinking about investing in your company and want to know everything about the opportunity before they write that cheque | For you, being organized throughout the process will demonstrate that you have deep knowledge of the company and its executive capabilities. It is in your best interests to fully cooperate and provide as much information as you can to help them decide to invest in **YOU** |
