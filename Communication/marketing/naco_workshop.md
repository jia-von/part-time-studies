## Angel Groups - Canadian Landscapes
- 45 + angel groups in Canada. Angel Groups do not compete on deals. **They syndicate**.
- Groups borrow expertise from each other.
- Opportunities that are not a good fit for one group can be referred to another group that might be a better fit. 

### Typical Angel Network Process

| Application | Populate the Data Room | The Pitch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application via email, website, angel, ecosystem partner. Review-screening to select eligible companies | Company materials are uploaded to an accessible online database | 3 companies deliver 12-15 minute pitch at an investor meetings. Deeper dive with angels who are interested. |

Typical Journey:
We Source Deal Flow -->  Screening --> Coaching --> Selection --> Investment Meeting --> Lead Investors --> Due Diligence --> Syndication --> Close --> After the $ Post Investment Follow Up

Note: 
- Maple leaf pre-screen, Thursday office hours? - investigate later. 
- York angels (80 members) has virtual screening session? - investigate later. - Usually end up with 3 to 4 companies. 
- Keynote: *Show potential to grow*
- Average of 650 applications are year, but only 30 made into the screening.
- *Talk to customer and explaining value. Customer feedback is good way to evaluate*
- *Average journey is 4-12 weeks*

### Funding-Investment Journey

| Pre-Seed Stage | Seed and Seed Extension | Populate the Data Room |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Friends and Family | Angel Investors | CDN VCs |
| Incubators, pitch competitions and entrepreneurship programs | Angel Syndicates | US VCs |
| n/a | Government Funders | Strategic investors |
| n/a | Seed Stage VC's | n/a |

Note:
- Using family and friends network as an example/story to show how other people trust in *you*. 
- Historical/government funding as proof of concepts and example. 
- *Some skin in the game* - probs keyword. 

### Valuation
- No substantive financial history to help set valuation.
- Take a top-down approach when estimating your company's value -- from market size to forecasted revenue.
- Providing an exagerrated valuation of your company can be a deal killer.
- Valuation of an early, pre-revenue company is more art and negotation than accounting and science. 
- In addition to the assets of the company, valuation will be influenced by the risk assessment of a future exit. 
  - At what price?
  - What time frame?
  - What size will the company be?
  - What exit multiples?

Note:
- *Always get customers first. Valuation is secondary*.
- Book *Practical guide to angel investing* by NACO Academy Resources. 
- Always show *hockey stick*. 
- Keyword: *Milestones*.
- Counter valuation provided by investor. **Bring on the receipts, mic-drop.**
- Investor like to have *x times the value in return*.
