### What Do Investors Look For?

| Elements | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Business opportunity in superior product | *Potential, growth, success, liquidity at the end of the journey. Is it sustainable and does it have value.* |
| Business model they understand | *Sustainable, value, build base, build community, build critical mass. How to convert eyeballs into revenue. One-time or recurring. Historical model vs. current model vs. future model.* |
| High Growth Potential | *Accelerate high growth opportunity*. | 
| Sustainable Competitive Advantage | *If no one else is doing it, potentially it means no one else is interested in it. Competitive advantage. Identify the competitor in the similar space as us.* |
| Quality Management Team | *What is the team like? What experience? What they have achieved to be leveraged? Who are the key resources we're missing and need funding for to fill the missing gap.* |
| If funds raised previously, were they used wisely? | *What is historical expectation/knowledge, goals, sprint. Did we surpassed it? What is the financial historical journey* |
| Realistic and alternative exit and liquidity | n/a |
| Existing Customers and Partners | n/a |

| Professional Business Practices | n/a |
| Coachability | n/a |

## Angel Groups - Canadian Landscapes
- 45 + angel groups in Canada. Angel Groups do not compete on deals. **They syndicate**.
- Groups borrow expertise from each other.
- Opportunities that are not a good fit for one group can be referred to another group that might be a better fit. 

### Typical Angel Network Process

| Application | Populate the Data Room | The Pitch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application via email, website, angel, ecosystem partner. Review-screening to select eligible companies | Company materials are uploaded to an accessible online database | 3 companies deliver 12-15 minute pitch at an investor meetings. Deeper dive with angels who are interested. |

Typical Journey:
We Source Deal Flow -->  Screening --> Coaching --> Selection --> Investment Meeting --> Lead Investors --> Due Diligence --> Syndication --> Close --> After the $ Post Investment Follow Up

Note: 
- Maple leaf pre-screen, Thursday office hours? - investigate later. 
- York angels (80 members) has virtual screening session? - investigate later. - Usually end up with 3 to 4 companies. 
- Keynote: *Show potential to grow*
- Average of 650 applications are year, but only 30 made into the screening.
- *Talk to customer and explaining value. Customer feedback is good way to evaluate*
- *Average journey is 4-12 weeks*

### Funding-Investment Journey

| Pre-Seed Stage | Seed and Seed Extension | Populate the Data Room |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Friends and Family | Angel Investors | CDN VCs |
| Incubators, pitch competitions and entrepreneurship programs | Angel Syndicates | US VCs |
| n/a | Government Funders | Strategic investors |
| n/a | Seed Stage VC's | n/a |

Note:
- Using family and friends network as an example/story to show how other people trust in *you*. 
- Historical/government funding as proof of concepts and example. 
- *Some skin in the game* - probs keyword. 

### Valuation
- No substantive financial history to help set valuation.
- Take a top-down approach when estimating your company's value -- from market size to forecasted revenue.
- Providing an exagerrated valuation of your company can be a deal killer.
- Valuation of an early, pre-revenue company is more art and negotation than accounting and science. 
- In addition to the assets of the company, valuation will be influenced by the risk assessment of a future exit. 
  - At what price?
  - What time frame?
  - What size will the company be?
  - What exit multiples?

Note:
- *Always get customers first. Valuation is secondary*.
- Book *Practical guide to angel investing* by NACO Academy Resources. 
- Always show *hockey stick*. 
- Keyword: *Milestones*.
- Counter valuation provided by investor. **Bring on the receipts, mic-drop.**
- Investor like to have *x times the value in return*.

## The Investment Instrument

| The Terms | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| We will invest X $ into your company in exchange for X % of the company. | Common shares were used in 38% of investments |
| Angel investors use a variety of investment instruments. | Convertible debentures were used in 29% of investments |
| n/a | Preffered shares were used in 19% of investments. |
| n/a | SAFE Notes were used in 12% of investments. |
| n/a | Debt instruments are uncommon and were used in just 2% of investments |

**Term Sheet Quick Info**

| Term Sheet Quick Info | The term sheet should not have any surprises -- if a group is interested they will probably have discussed valuation with you during the process.  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What is the equity position that an angel will take while ensuring the entrepenuer highly focused on growth? | How much is the investor providing and how much are you giving in return. | They set out the terms that will be used in a more formal closing document. | These are often shorter documents. |
| What are the size of the units (i.e. how many investors on cap table - you need to keep an eye on this number) | What percentage the investor is taking | What is the form of the investment |  Angels typically don't want to take a large percentage (usually 15-25%) |
|  Angel investors want **you** to run the business -- they are not operators | The term sheet and any subsequent details often moves along in parallel with due diligence. | Once the investment is ready to move forward there will be a subscription agreement and some form of loan documentation. | Each investor has to own their investment in their own name since most angel groups do not pool their funds -- the group is made up of a collection on individuals. |

Note:
- *Making sure the entrepenuer is extremely dedicated in growing the company.*
- *Give a thought about term sheet tools.*

##

| Common Share | A **Common Share** deal aligns founders and funders with the same class of shares, and fully negotiates all rights and terms in the Shareholders' Agreement. | It may be used at any stage of deal before a Series A, as long as valuation can be agreed upon. |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pro's** | Creates alignment between the founder and investor | Relatively easy and commonly accepted form of term sheet | Avoids different share classes and onerous calculations | Relatively quick and simple to negotiate and execute |  |
| **Con's** | Requires a sophisticated investor who can negotiate valuation and additional terms | Due to the required sophistication, it is not a good fit for the Family & Friend investment stage | May not include all the protection an investor wants | it may lack in valuation too early | May not work for US investors | 

##

| Preferred Shares | The **Preferred Share** term sheet, also called *Preferred Light*, is commonly used for a later and larger seed round. |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pro's** | Protect investor rights | Sets up the corporate structure in such a way that investor returns are paramount to other (Common) shareholders | Protects the investor against later and more powerful (institutional) investors | Investors from the US recognize and like Preferred Share term sheets |
| **Con's** | There is an element of unfairness to the founders | The term sheet can be complex | May have an impact on the ease of landing future rounds |  |

##

| Convertible Loan | **Convertible Loan** is commonly used as part of the first financing of a company when valuation can't be agreed on, or as a bridge ahead of a larger Seed or Series A round |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pro's** | Defers valuation discussion and may enable a *rolling close* | Provides a route from an already priced round to a future priced round; it's the bridge to extend the runway and validate a price increase | It is a relatively simple deal structure leading to a quick close | Investors are considered lenders and not shareholders and this may provide security rights to protect | Provides some flexibility | 
| **Con's** | Often add pressure for investor returns | There are no shareholder rights or ways to influence |  |  |  |

##

| Canadian SAFE | The **Canadian Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE)** is modelled after the Y Combinator SAFE. In this template a cap, a discount, and a maturity date were added to make it more appropriate for the Canadian market. |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pro's** | It is asimple and gast agreement, a figurative *papered handshake* | It favours the company much like a convertible loan can | It works best in a hot/active market with promising startups | It can assist with obtaining a tax credit in certain provinces | 
| **Con's** | It is an open-ended deal and the investor can be legt *hanging* | Can be used inappropriately, if the founder is not properly knowledgeable on the structure | Some formats may not work in Canada |  |
