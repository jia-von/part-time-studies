# Smart Home Case Study
This is part of a group project I have been working with other students. This document is to help take note of the topics I have studied.

## Background
Early home automation systems do not include internet connectivity, which is currently a common element in modern home automation systems. Modern home automation rely heavily on Internet of Things (IoT)

- Smart Home System requires a lot of sensors to collect data this can be done through sensor nodes integrated with low-end microcontrollers.
- Gateway aggregates data, display data locally, allow local control on smart home functionality, push data to cloud for post processing, or even perform some simple decisions locally.
- Cloud computing is important and perform intelligent  analytics to improve the quality of life.

| Feature | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | Alarm system, surveillance, and reporting. | **Door Lock**: key-less lock, biometric sensing; **Surveillance Camera**: monitoring any person walking near or entering the house; **Vibration Sensor**: Detect vibration generated when someone attempts to remove the grill; **Magnetic Door Lock**: Control opening of the door | 
| Control | TV, Fan, Air Conditioning, Lighting, and Doors. | **Smart Air Conditioner**: Sense surrounding temperature and automatically adjust it; **Smart Fan**: Turn on/off the fan via voice (microphone) or gesture control (gesture sensor); **Smart Lighting**: Adjust intensity automatically |
| Lifestyle | Automatic clothes washing and hanging, smart gardening. | **Soil moisture sensor**: Measure the water content in soil and water the plants automatically; **sensor**: design a system to move the clothes back under the shade when rain is detected |
| Energy Saving | Energy consumption monitoring, hotspot identification, and smart energy control | **Smoke detector**; **Smart Metering**: Record usage of electricity, pay bill automatically, generate alert to user when the electricity is expensive; **Energy Monitoring**: Keep track on energy usage of every electrical appliances, identify the hotspot, which appliances uses the most energy; **Energy Saving**: dim/turn off the lights when no one is present, adjust the contrast of the TV based on surrounding environment |

## Security

| Sensors | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Passive Infrared Sensor | Detect infrared radiation generated by living organisms. Sense moving objects, usually placed at the top of the house. |
| Magnetic Sensor | Detect door open/closing |
| Vibration Sensor | Detect vibration generated when someone attempt to remove protective grill through sawing or welding |
| Surveillance Camera | Monitor anyone walking near or entering the house |
| Others | Such as smoke sensors and air quality sensors |

## Actuators

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Magnetic Door Lock | Controls the opning of doors; usually controlled through a relay |
| Smart Gardening | Watering the garden according to various parameter set |
| Alarm/Siren | Notifying mobile device right away and live stream vidoes |
| Automatic Gate | Keyless entry; direct current motors control the opening/closing of the doors |

## Communication

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sensor nodes | Designed based on the low-end microcontroller + sensors; communicates with gateway using wireless local network; sensor nodes connect directly to the cloud for status update |
| Gateway | Designed based on high end processor; communicate with cloud through WLAN/ethernet; need only one gateway for the whole house; include additional reporting with mobile network |

## Gateway

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Process Data | Data processing and aggregation can be performed in gateway to reduce the communication cost; allow control to Smart Home System; Set the threshold temperature to turn on the fan; Automatically turn on/off the lighting (to simulate human activity and prevent burglary) when user is away; Push data to the cloud; Display data locally |
| Make Decision | Simple decisions can also be made accordingly (turn on/off devices/appliances automatically) in gateway |

## Data Visualization

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | Ways to visualize data locally | dedicated LCD screen touch screen to allow choice selection; arm-disarm security areas; check current energy consumption; groceries recommendation based on promotion from nearby grocery store |
|  |  The processor needs hardware acceleration to  support an LCD; not possible for small sensor nodes |  |
|  | may be integrated with a gateway |  |
| Mobile | Smartphone is a very good platform for this | Communicate with gateway to pull the collected data; Communication through WLAN or Bluetooth; access home automation system from anywhere inside the house |
| Cloud | Data collected from smart home system can be consumed locally (through gateway) as well as stored in the cloud for analytics |  |
|  |  There are many cloud solutions and visualization tools available |  |
