# Smart Home Case Study
This is part of a group project I have been working with other students. This document is to help take note of the topics I have studied.

## Background
Early home automation systems do not include internet connectivity, which is currently a common element in modern home automation systems. Modern home automation rely heavily on Internet of Things (IoT)
