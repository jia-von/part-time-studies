# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
There are seven categories AI influences our world:
- Image Analysis
- Visual Assistants
- Predictive Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Self Driving Technologies
- Robotics 

## Use Case AI
Credit Card Fraud Detection with real time detection of fraud and produces easily measured financial benefits.

## Field of AI
| Artificial Narrow Intelligence | Artificial General Intelligence | AI Landscape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Machines that perform singular work very well better than humans | Machine the immitate human and human mind | Computer science field that deals with machines and algorithms to immitate humans |

## Explainability Concept
Wikipedia describe [Explainable AI (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) refers to methods and techniques in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) such that the results of the solution can be understood by humans. It contrasts with the concept of the "black box" in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.

## Biases and Ethics
- Exploratory Data Analysis by John Turkey

Article from [Understanding Data Bias](https://towardsdatascience.com/survey-d4f168791e57) by Krishnamurthy. 
- Response or Activity Bias occurs in content generated by humans
- Selection bias due to feedback loops, bias occurs when a model itself influences the generation of data that is used to train it. 
- Bias due to system drift: Drift refers to changes over time to the system generating the data.
- Omitted variable bias occurs in data in which critical attributes that influence the outcome are missing.
    - The omitted variable must be correlated with the dependent (target) variable.
    - The omitted variable must be correlated with one or more other explanatory (or predictor) variables.
- Societal bias occurs in content produced by humans.
