# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
There are seven categories AI influences our world:
- Image Analysis
- Visual Assistants
- Predictive Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Self Driving Technologies
- Robotics 

## Use Case AI
Credit Card Fraud Detection with real time detection of fraud and produces easily measured financial benefits.

## Field of AI
| Artificial Narrow Intelligence | Artificial General Intelligence | AI Landscape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Machines that perform singular work very well better than humans | Machine the immitate human and human mind | Computer science field that deals with machines and algorithms to immitate humans |

## Explainability Concept
Wikipedia describe [Explainable AI (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) refers to methods and techniques in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) such that the results of the solution can be understood by humans. It contrasts with the concept of the "black box" in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.

## Biases and Ethics
- Exploratory Data Analysis by John Turkey

Article from *[Understanding Data Bias](https://towardsdatascience.com/survey-d4f168791e57)* by Krishnamurthy. 
- **Response** or **Activity Bias** occurs in content generated by humans
- **Selection bias** due to feedback loops, bias occurs when a model itself influences the generation of data that is used to train it. 
- Bias due to **system drift**: Drift refers to changes over time to the system generating the data.
- **Omitted variable bias** occurs in data in which critical attributes that influence the outcome are missing.
    - The omitted variable must be correlated with the dependent (target) variable.
    - The omitted variable must be correlated with one or more other explanatory (or predictor) variables.
- **Societal bias** occurs in content produced by humans.

# Machine Learning
There is a two type of machine learning, **supervised** machine learning and **unsupervised** machine learning. 

## Machine Learning Review
*[Types of Machine Learning Algorithms You Should Know](https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-953a08248861)* writen by Fumo. 
- **Labeled data**: Data consisting of a set of training examples, where each example is a pair consisting of an input and a desired output value.
- **Classification**: The goal is to predict discrete values.
- **Regression**: The goal is to predict continuous values

| Types of ML | Description | Example | Common Algorithms | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supervised |  model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features | human experts act as the teacher to feed training data and evaluate the correct answers | nearest neighbour, naive bayes, decision trees, linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks |
| Unsupervised | computer trained with unlabeled data | mainly used in pattern detection/descriptive modeling, no output categories or labels to model relationships, use input data to mine for rules, detect patterns, summarize and group data points | k-mean clustering, association rules |
| Semi-supervised | it is a balance between supervised and unsupervised due to cost | even though the group memberships of the unlabeled data are unknown, this data carries important information about the group parameters | n/a |
| Reinforcement | continuously learns from the environment in an iterative fashion, learns from its experiences of the environment until it explores the full range of possible states | reinforcement signal is required for this type of ML | Markov Decision Process, Q-Learning, temporal difference, deep adversarial networks |

## Introduction to Machine Learning Review
A review based on *[A visual introduction to machine learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)*
- categorizing data points is a **classification** task.
- dimensions in a data set are called **features**, **predictors**, or **variables**.
- identifying boundaries in data using math is statistical learning.
- creating a model is also known as **training** a model
- A decision tree uses if-then statements to define patterns in data. These statements are called **forks**, and they split the data into two **branches** based on some value. That value between the branches is called a **split point**. At the **best split**, the results of each branch should be as homogeneous as possible.
- **Recursion** is to add another split point, the algorithm repeats the process above on the subsets of data and recursion appears frequently in training models
- Additional forks will add new information that can increase a tree's **prediction accuracy**.
- Finally these branches of the tree are called **leaf nodes**.
- To test the tree's performance on new data, apply it to data points that it has never seen before. This unused data is called **test data**.
- **Overfitting** happens when some boundaries are based on on distinctions that don't make a difference.

### Model Tuning and Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Simplest decision tree is called *stump* and it is made of a single rule. 
- A model with too much bias systematically ignores relevant details and is wrong in *consistent* ways.
- To decrease the error due to bias, you can add additional splits to the tree.
- Overly-complex tree suffers from errors due to **variance**. High-variance models make mistakes by overfitting to the idiosyncrasies of the training data. They tend to be wrong in *inconsistent* ways.

| Less Complex Model | More Complex Model | Overall model error | Ideal Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ignores relevant information, and error due to bias is high. As the model becomes more complex, error due to bias decreases | when a model is less complex, error due to variance is low. Error due to variance increases as complexity increases |  is a function of error due to bias plus error due to variance | minimizes error from each |

# Deep Learning
Deep learning is based on neural networks and it implement algorithms to simulate how the human brain works. Neural network is based on a single *neuron* called *perceptron*. Example of a deep learning algorithm is called recurrent neural network (RNN) and it is primarily invovled in natural language processing (NLP).

Notion of intent is important in the research of AI.
