# Introduction to Internet of Things (IoT)
- The Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of millions of smart devices and sensors connected to the Internet. These connected devices and sensors collect and share data for use and evaluation by many organizations.
- A sensor needs to be connected to a network so that the gathered data can be stored and shared. 
- Sensors often work together with a device called an actuator. Actuators take electrical input and transform the input into physical action.

## Network Types
- Personal area networks are small networks where connected wireless devices are within personal reach. 
- LANs are typically networks in a small or local geographic area, such as a home, small business or department within a large corporation.
- The term WAN typically refers to a collection of LANs that provides inter-LAN and Internet connectivity for businesses and governments. 
- Internet The Internet is a multi-layer global network system that connects hundreds of millions of computers.
- Wireless networks are those computer networks that use electromagnetic waves instead of wires in order to carry signals over the various parts of the network. 
-  The cloud is not as much a type of network as it is a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers that are used to store and analyze data, provide access to on-line applications, and provide backup services for personal and corporate use.
- The edge refers to the physical “edge” of a corporate network. 
- With the rising number of sensors used by the Internet of Things, there is often a need to store the sensor data securely and closer to where the data can be analyzed. This analyzed data can then be used quickly and effectively to update or modify processes within the organization.
  - The fog is located at the edge of a business or corporate network. Servers and computer programs allow the data to be pre-processed for immediate use. 

## Intent-Based Networking (IBN)
In an intent-based networking system (IBN), all the network devices will be automatically configured to fulfil this requirement across the network, no matter where the employee is connected. VLAN, subnet, ACL and all other details will be automatically defined and configured following best practices. The intent has to be defined once in a central management console, and then, the network will continuously assure it, even if there are changes in the network.

## Python
- The range() function generates a list of numbers usually used to iterate with FOR loops. 
  - range(stop) - This is the number of integers (whole numbers) to generate, starting from zero.
  - range([start], stop, [step]) – This is the starting number of the sequence, the ending number in the sequence, and the difference between each number in the sequence.
- A tuple is a sequence of unchangeable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, separated by parentheses.
- Lists are a sequence of changeable Python objects. Lists can be created by putting different comma-separated values between square brackets. 
- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing standard math operations on sets such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.
- Dictionary is a list of elements that are separated by commas. Each element is a combination of a value and a unique key. Each key is separated from its value by a colon. The entire dictionary is written within braces. Dictionary elements can be accessed, updated, and deleted.

## Prototyping
Prototyping is the process of creating a rudimentary working model of a product or system. For prototyping in the IoT, it helps to have design skills, electrical skills, physical/mechanical skills (work with your hands to put things together), programming skills, and to understand how TCP/IP works.
- [Arduino](arduino.cc) is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple microcontroller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board. You can develop interactive objects that take input from a variety of switches or sensors to control lights, motors, and other physical objects.
- The [Beaglebone](http://beagleboard.org/) is very similar to the Raspberry Pi in size, power requirements, and application. The Beaglebone has more processing power than the Raspberry Pi

### Course
- The [MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/intro-programming/) is a web-based publication of almost all MIT course content. Open and available to the world, OCW is a great place to get familiar with computer programming for free.
